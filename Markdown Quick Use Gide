## Formatting the text

#### Italics

To make an item appear in italics, you will need to wrap it inside of an asterisks pair.  See below for an example.

"You see, the woman called her a *harlot* and left!

#### Bold
To make an item appear bold, use double asterisks to wrap the target.  See below:

"No, that is **NOT** the sandwich I ordered!"

#### Bold & Italics

To use both the bold and italics format, simply increase the asterisk count to 3 to wrap it.  See below:

***"I was lost inside my own head.  Thinking thoughts that should not be.  What was I going to do?  Could I really eat a hot sauce and jelly sandwich?"***


#### Using Links in Markdown

To use a link, you need to perform two simple steps.

1. Wrap the word(s) that will house the link in a square bracket, **[  ]**.

2. Following the brackets, wrap the actual link in parentheses, **( )**.

Looking at the example below, you can see I also added double asterisks to the link to make it bold.

#### Using Images in Markdown

To insert an image, it is much the same as using a link.
You simply have to include an exclamation mark in front of the square brackets. 

"![Description of the image](Image link)"

#### List

You can make lists with little effort in Markdown.
For numbered list, you can simply order it via the use of number.  See below.

1. This is item 1
2. This is item 2
3. This is item 3

For bullets, you can use an asterisk or the plus symbol.  Markdown will convert them to bullet points. See below.

* This is another item 1
* This is another item 2
* This is another item 3

**Note**: You can use an indent of four spaces to nest a list within a list.

* Fruits
    * Mango
    * Apple
* Meats
    * Beef
    * Steak

#### Using Quotes

To use denote a quote, simply prefix the line with a ">".
See the example below.

>It was the worst of times, it was the best of times..


#### Inserting a line divider
To use a quick horizontal divider, use three dashes.
You can see it in use below.

#### Using Code Snippets

 Using a single back-tick around a word in a sentence, you can show a quick code snippet.

 Indenting by 4 spaces will turn an entire paragraph into a code-block.

 `Let age = 34;
